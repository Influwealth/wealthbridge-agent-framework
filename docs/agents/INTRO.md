# Agents – Introduction

Agents are the active intelligence of WealthBridge OS. They:

- Observe state and inputs.
- Reason and plan.
- Execute actions.
- Collaborate with other agents and humans.
- Use capsules and MCP servers as tools.

## Core Components

- **Agent Kernel** – Core runtime for agent execution.
- **Agent Memory** – Vector-based recall and long-term context.
- **Agent Planner** – Multi-step reasoning and planning.
- **Agent Actions** – Safe, auditable action layer.
- **Protocols (A2A, A2P)** – Agent-to-agent and agent-to-person communication.

Agents are not “chatbots”—they are processes that can be supervised, composed, and audited.
