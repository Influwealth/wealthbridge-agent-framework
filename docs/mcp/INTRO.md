# MCP – Model Context Protocol

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the standard interface WealthBridge OS uses to connect:

- Tools
- Data sources
- External APIs
- Capsules
- Agents

An MCP server exposes:

- **Tools** – Actions the model can call.
- **Resources** – Data the model can read.
- **Prompts / Flows** – Higher-level behaviors.

## Example MCP Servers

- **Tradeline MCP** – Credit tradeline analysis and optimization.
- **DeepFlex MCP** – Dynamic financial modeling and scenarios.
- **Gov MCP (IRS/DOL/SBA)** – Regulatory and government interfaces.
- **Data Commons MCP** – Aggregated financial data.
- **GMP MCP** – External model providers.

MCP makes the system interoperable and future-proof.
