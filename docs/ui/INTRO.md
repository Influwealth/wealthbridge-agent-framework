# User Interfaces – Introduction

WealthBridge OS uses multiple UIs, each with a specific role:

- **MCP‑UI** – View and manage MCP servers and capsules.
- **AG‑UI** – Orchestrate agents, see plans, and supervise execution.
- **Control Plane** – Human-in-the-loop cockpit for high-stakes operations.
- **Agent Console** – CLI/TUI for power users and operators.

On the S23, MCP‑UI is the first live interface. It proves that the node is active and capable of hosting WealthBridge OS experiences.
