# Capsules – Introduction

Capsules are the modular building blocks of WealthBridge OS. Each capsule:

- Encapsulates a specific domain or capability.
- Has clear inputs, outputs, and state.
- Can be called by agents, MCP servers, or UIs.
- Is observable and auditable.

## Example Capsules

- **Unit Capsule** – Fundamental financial units and calculations.
- **Business Registry Capsule** – Entities, relationships, and registrations.
- **Compute Capsule** – Access to compute resources across nodes.
- **UB-TWA Capsule** – User behavior and time-weighted analysis.
- **Observability Capsule** – Metrics, logs, traces.
- **Compliance Capsule** – Regulatory checks and audit trails.

Capsules make WealthBridge OS teachable, testable, and composable.
